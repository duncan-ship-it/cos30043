1. Is the font type in helloworld2.html similar to helloworld.html (you created in the first week)?

The font style is now sans serif, rather than the default serif font seen in the original task.

2. What happens if you remove `<div class="container"></div>`?

The heading appears directly to the left, whereas before there was margin between the left side of the viewport and the text.

3. What is the purpose of `<div class="container"></div>`?

This provides a container for the contents. The container limits the maximum width of the contents, and horizontally centers itself on the page.
